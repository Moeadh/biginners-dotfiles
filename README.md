# Dotfiles made by a simple man

I don't want to see you starting from zero, this is a nice beginners start, just clone the repository if you have a github account or install the compressed file, extract it and use the install.sh
When I change the destro or loss the theming files for some reason, I search in github about some cool repos like this one to dno't pain again, but I don't find them.
that's the reason of making and improving this repository.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moeadh/beginners-dotfiles.git
cd beginners-dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
